Personal reminders of things that needs doing

* World API -> Movement API
* Figure out inventories
* "Friendly" emit plugin
* More specific platform support epoll/kqueue/libuv
* BoundBuffer and pl_announce could use better homes
* DOCUMENTATION: ~~At least make a docs folder~~ Docs folder made!
* Make demo less shit
* Throw out nbt.py, build something much simpler
* packet_extensions needs more intuitive "array" handling
* datautils, just, fix it...
* Spin mcp and mcmap out into their own packages/projects?
* Arbitrary proto version support
* Support legacy authentication?
* Consider Python 2.7 support
