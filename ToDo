Personal reminders of things that needs doing

* Remove decompression from mcmap, moved to mcpacket_extensions
* If packet can't decode, throwaway.
* Set max throwaways until shutdown
* World API -> Movement API
* Figure out inventories
* More specific platform support epoll/kqueue/libuv
* DOCUMENTATION: ~~At least make a docs folder~~ Docs folder made!
* Make demo less shit
* Spin mcp/mcmap/pluginloader out into their own packages/projects?
* Arbitrary proto version support
* Consider Python 2.7 support
