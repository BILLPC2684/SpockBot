Personal reminders of shit that needs doing

* World API -> Movement API
* Reorganize net.plugins folder, seperate "core" plugins from "helper" plugins
* Figure out inventories
* "Friendly" emit plugin
* Timer plugin, fix timers in general
* More specific platform support epoll/kqueue/libuv
* Get rid of cflags
* Find better homes from spock.utils, spock.smpmap, spock.bound_buffer
* DOCUMENTATION: At least make a docs folder
* Make demo less shit
* Throw out nbt.py, build something much simpler
* packet_extensions needs more intuitive "array" handling
* datautils, just, fix it...
* Spin mcp out into own package/project?
* Arbitrary proto version support
* Support legacy authentication?
* Consider Python 2.7 support
