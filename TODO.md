Personal reminders of things that needs doing

ToDo

* Pathfinding API
* Expand World API/smpmap2
* Make physics more correct/fix liquid physics/more correct gravity/implement creative mode flight/many other things (knockback lol)
* "Getting Started" Guide for devs
* Figure out inventories
* Find a home for entity tracking
* Make demo less shit

Ideas

* Spin mcp/mcmap/pluginloader out into their own packages/projects?
* Arbitrary proto version support
* More specific platform support epoll/kqueue/libuv
